The core idea behind distributional semantics has roots in American structuralism (Harris) and British lexicology (Firth) and is known as the distributional hypothesis. In its simplest form, it states that ``similarity in meaning results in similarity of linguistic distribution \parencite{harris}''.

The reverse of this statement is also true. Meaning that ``the statistical distribution of linguistic items in context plays a key role in characterizing their semantic behavior \parencite{lenci}''. The aim of distributional semantics is exactly that, to learn the meanings of linguistics units from a corpus of text.

Distributional semantics was popularised by Firth in the 1950s. In a 1957 publication he wrote, ``the placing of a text as a constituent in a context of situation contributes to the statement of meaning since situations are set up to recognise use. <...> You shall know a word by the company it keeps! \parencite[11]{firth}''.

The ideas introduced by the distributional hypothesis have received attention in cognitive science \parencite{mcdonald} and language learning \parencite{yarlett}.% }}}
